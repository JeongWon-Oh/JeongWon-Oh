I'm **Jeong Won Oh (David Kim Oh)**.

I'm planned to enter **Tokyo Institute of Technology** in April 2022.
I'll study for a master's degree in Information and Communications Engineering as a member of **CARAS**, under the supervision of Prof. Sasaki.

I'll receive a B.S. degree from **Yonsei University** in February 2022. I majored in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the College of Engineering.
